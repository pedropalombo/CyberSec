\-> lots of buggy code
\-> running untrusted code securely
 (-> npm install <lib>
\-> "Mashups"
 (-> different sites interacting with the same tab
\-> hardware access
 (-> running code anywhere on the machine, using camera, etc
\-> backwards compatibility requirements
 (-> what we desire has to also work in the past
\-> social engineering
\-> if it's vulnerable, it's profitable
